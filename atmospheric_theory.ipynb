    "The properties of the air that rockets travel through have a significant impact on flight dynamics. The primary effects are that the air gets thinner (i.e. less dense) as you go higher (which reduces the drag on the rocket), changing air temperature (only decreasing with altitude in the ranges that we fly to) and decreasing pressure."

    "\n",
    "The atmosphere is divided into layers based on temperature gradients, chemical composition, and air density. This repository focuses on flight through the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the troposphere, as that is the only layer of the atmosphere that most rockets made by students and hobbyists will reach. However, for completeness, the other layers of the atmosphere are briefly described below. The 5 primary layers of Earth's atmoshpere are:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Name         | Altitude Range | Temperature Gradient | Mass Fraction |\n",
    "|--------------|----------------|----------------------------------| --------------|\n",
    "| Troposphere  | Surface to 6-20 km* | Decreases with altitude | ~80% of the atmosphere's mass |\n",
    "| Stratosphere | 6-20 km to 50 km | Increases with altitude | ~19% of the atmosphere's mass |\n",
    "| Mesosphere   | 50 km to 80 km | Decreases with altitude | ~0.1% of the atmosphere's mass |\n",
    "| Thermosphere | 80 km to 550 km** | Increases with altitude | ~0.002% of the atmosphere's mass |\n",
    "| Exosphere    | 550 km to 10,000 km | N/A*** | N/A |\n",
    "\n",
    "*The altitude range of the troposphere varies, and depends primarily on latitude. It ranges from 6 km at the poles to 20 km at the equator. The transition between the troposphere and stratosphere is called the tropopause. Within the tropopause, the temperature remains relatively constant as altitude increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The boundary of space is typically considered to be at an altitude of 100 km, known as the Kármán line. 99.99997% of the atmosphere's mass is below this altitude. The ISS orbits at an altitude of around 400 km, and other satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) are typically between 160 km and 2,000 km above the Earth's surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "***The exosphere is the transition between the upper atmosphere and cislunar space. The density of air in this layer is so low that the concept of a temperature gradient is no longer meaningful. The thermopause is located at the top of the thermosphere, and is considered the atmospheric boundary of Earth's energy system. \n",

    "A lapse rate is an average value that can vary significantly depending on the time of day, time of year, location, and weather conditions. The temperature profile that a rocket encounters during flight will invariably differ from that predicted by a perfectly linear lapse rate. However, microscale meteorological phenomena generally don't have a significant impact on the temperature profile that a rocket will encounter, and accounting for mesoscale meteorological phenomena by using data for a specific location at the same time of day and year is more than sufficient for amateur rocketry, and unless you are really trying to target a specific apogee, the standard lapse rate is more than sufficient.\n",
